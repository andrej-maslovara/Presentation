        <!--I'm not really a movie guy, I mostly like comedies so im going to put some that I remember the most-->
        <li><h4>"The invention of Lying"</h4>

            <p>Amazing movie depicting how as the title says, that lying often
                <br>kind of brings problems into our lives in the long run,
                <br>but rarely actually does good. 
                <br>Also incredibly hilarious :)

        <li><h4>"You Don't Mess with the Zohan"</h4>

            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0960144/">

            <br>

            <p>Altough the movie got bad reviews and a poor grade, I still laughed
            <br>so hard, I just love this kind of goofy parody stuff.

        <li><h4>"Forest Gump"</h4>
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/forest-gump.jpg" alt="Forest Gump">

            <br>

            <p>This isn't a comedy, altough there are some funny parts.
            <br>To me this is by far one of the best, if not thee best movie
            <br>of all time. It literally has everything in it, it's truly
            <br>amazing how eye opening it is and how reality can hit you hard.
            <br>It has incredbile acting, screenplay, storytelling, directing...
            <br>Definitely makes you rethink life and have a small epiphany.
