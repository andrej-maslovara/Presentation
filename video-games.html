        <li><h4>"Heroes of the Storm"</h4>

            <p>Altough it's MOBA parents are more popular, to me it's an amazing game.
            <br>Blizzard is really good at keeping it balanced and interesting,
            <br>and that's why I prefer it over the others. Haven't played for a long time
            <br>ever since I got kids basically, but this is the game I would go back to when
            <br>I get some free time, also almost got to Grand Master rank when I stopped.

        <li><h4>"Hearthstone"</h4>

            <br>

            <p>Best card game out there, at least in digital form.
            <br>Got to Legend rank a few times, but now I don't think
            <br>I can play it anymore competitively since all the updates and new stuff.
            </p>

        <li><h4>"Overwatch"</h4>

            </a>
            <br>

            <p>Truly a revolutionary game as a FPS/MOBA hybrid, also would
            <br>play again when I get the time.
            </p>

        <li><h4>"Overcooked"</h4>

            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/448510/Overcooked/" target="_blank">

            <br>

            <p>Funny and exciting game to play with your friends, highly recommend :)</p>

        <li><h4>"Hollow Knight"</h4>

            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/hollow-knight.jpg" alt="Hollow Knight banner">
            </a>
            <br>

            <p>I played a lot of games Single and Multi player, and in my experience
            <br>this game is truly amazing, so detailed, mysterious and yet so challenging
            <br>but not so much that you want to quit it, just enough to push yourself
            <br>to explore everyhing, unlock everything and defeat all enemies.
            <br>When you dedicate yourself a little into it, you will find yourself
            <br>lost in time playing it. I have never immersed myself into a Single player
            <br>game as much as this one, that's why it deserves to be in the top tier list.
